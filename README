This software is an implementation of the 3D morphable model, as defined
by Volker Blanz and Thomas Vetter in "A Morphable Model For The
Synthesis Of 3D Faces" (SIGGRAPH 99).

This software is released under the term of the GPLv3 license.

To use the code as is, you will need to ask for an access to the Basel
Face Model database
(http://faces.cs.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php?nav=1-1-0&id=details). As per
the license of the database, I'm not allowed to redistribute it.
